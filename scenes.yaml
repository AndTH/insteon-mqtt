# Scenes Definition File
#
# This file allows users to define scenes that should exist on their network.
# This enables the sync and delete links functions to work.  A user is not
# required to have a scenes file, but it can make the process of maintianing
# a complex network of links easier by enabling the user to specify links in
# a single location rather than individually adding links to each device by
# hand.
